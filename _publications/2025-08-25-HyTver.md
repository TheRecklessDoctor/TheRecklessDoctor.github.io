This paper explored and introduced a novel loss function, HyTver for Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Lesion Segmentation. We conducted experiments to evaluate its performance and also compared its performance to a multitude of other loss functions used in Longitudianal MS Lesion Segmentation. We based our loss function off the Combo loss and optimised it to work in cases of extreme input imbalance.
