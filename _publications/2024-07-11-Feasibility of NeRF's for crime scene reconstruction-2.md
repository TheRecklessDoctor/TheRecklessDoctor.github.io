Crime scene reconstruction is an integral task in forensic analysis with current methods involving software that involves a significant amount of human input. With the rise of generative models, we investigated the feasibility of Neural Radiance Fields in crime scene reconstruction and analysed SOTA networks while comparing it to existing methods in crime scene reconstruction.
