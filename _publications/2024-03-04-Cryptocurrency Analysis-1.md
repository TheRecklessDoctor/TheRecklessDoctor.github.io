This paper involved an attempt to predict the prices of Bitcoin using not just the conventional financial data extracted from various API's and stock-market sites, but also including user-sentiments drawn from X(formerly Twitter). We compared both deep learning and machine learning models and drew a series of conclusions. Prediction of the prices and prediction of price movements were found to be tasks that different models excelled at, with GRU models excelling at the former and RNN's at the latter.
