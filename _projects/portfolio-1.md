This contains the solutions to the Bandit stage of Over The Wire. It deals with the usage of linux and Bash in preparation for cybersecurity and pentesting. The reason I am doing this is to learn Linux and Bash to an intermediate level and hopefully learn a bit of practical cybersecurity to round up my skillset. Also I want to learn to hack purely for interest too lol hahahah.

The solutions will be posted on github and the link is posted here.
